# Algorithm Efficiency Assignment

This repository contains implementations for the Randomized Quicksort algorithm and a Hash Table with Chaining for collision resolution.This assignment explores the efficiency and scalability of two fundamental algorithms: **Randomized Quicksort** and **Hashing with Chaining**. The goal is to understand how each algorithm performs under various conditions and to analyze the theoretical and empirical performance.
